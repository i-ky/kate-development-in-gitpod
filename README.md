# Kate development in Gitpod [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/i-ky/kate-development-in-gitpod)

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)
development environment for
[Kate text editor](https://kate-editor.org).

It follows
[Kate's Build It guide](https://kate-editor.org/build-it/)
with minor modifications to adapt it for Gitpod.
For example, `/workspace/kde/` is used instead of `~/projects/kde` to make it
[persist environment restarts](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle/#workspace-stopped).
